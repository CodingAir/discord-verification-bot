By promoting yourself you **get access to** the following things:\n\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Fast responding hotfixes\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Official releases\n<:dot:1024566211209597009>Colored premium rank\n\n**How it works**\nAfter clicking on the button below, you will be asked to enter your SpigotMC user name. The bot then searches for a payment that was registered in combination with your name. If there is a match, an email will be sent to your email address that was used to buy the plugin. The last thing you have to do now is to verify your individual promotion key in your mail. The entire process doesn't take longer than a minute!\n\n**Data Privacy**\nNone of your data will be stored in plaintext to ensure your data privacy. Email addresses will be encrypted with [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) and SpigotMC names will be hashed before storing them in the database. If you are interested in checking the code yourself, please go ahead and visit my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/erikzimmermann/discord-verification-bot).\n\n*Abusers can be reported and will be banned from this server!*"
